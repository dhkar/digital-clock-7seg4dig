# Digital Clock - 7 Segments, 4 Digits
3rd Assignment of EL3014 Microprocessor Systems, digital clock implementation source code and another files\

## Repository Files
This repository consists of two main files, that is:\ 
1. Arduino source code (src.ino) which is wrapped inside src folder\
2. Documentations (report) for grading purposes (In Indonesian)\

## Features of this Digital Clock
1. Display the current time (clock), and perform hrs:mnts:secs settings to calibrate the clock\
2. Give the alarm signals by blinking LED (with tunable duration) when current time is equal to the alarm clock  
  and perform hrs:mnts:secs settings to setup the time that alarm will trigger.\
3. Showing stopwatch (including reset and stop)\
4. 2 LED's which indicate the feature that digital clock performs in that time (alarm/stopwatch/clock)\
